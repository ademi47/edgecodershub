```

---

### Step 3: Run the Bot

## üé® Customization

### Method 1: Edit the Python File

Add custom rules directly in `email_auto_reply.py`:

```python
# Find the load_default_rules() function and add:
{
    "keywords": ["refund", "return"],
    "reply_template": """Hello,

Thank you for your refund request. Our team will process this 
within 5 business days.

Best regards"""
}
```

---

### Method 2: Use JSON Configuration

Edit `reply_rules.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "keywords": ["demo", "trial", "free trial"],
    "reply_template": "Hello,\n\nThank you for your interest in our demo!\n\nI'll send you access details within 24 hours.\n\nBest regards"
  }
]
```

**Load custom rules:**
```python
auto_reply = EmailAutoReply(EMAIL, APP_PASSWORD)
auto_reply.load_rules("reply_rules.json")
```

---

### Method 3: Add Rules Programmatically

```python
auto_reply = EmailAutoReply(EMAIL, APP_PASSWORD)

auto_reply.add_custom_rule(
    keywords=["partnership", "collaboration", "sponsor"],
    reply_template="Thank you for reaching out about partnership opportunities..."
)

# Save rules for next time
auto_reply.save_rules("my_custom_rules.json")
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom Date Range

Process emails from a specific date:

```python
from datetime import date

# Start from October 15, 2025
custom_date = date(2025, 10, 15)
auto_reply = EmailAutoReply(EMAIL, APP_PASSWORD, start_date=custom_date)
```

---

### Change Check Interval

```python
# Check every 30 seconds (instead of 60)
auto_reply.run_continuous(check_interval=30)

# Check every 5 minutes
auto_reply.run_continuous(check_interval=300)
```

---

### Process Once (No Continuous Loop)

```python
auto_reply = EmailAutoReply(EMAIL, APP_PASSWORD)
auto_reply.process_unread_emails()  # Process once and exit
```

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

**1. Use App Passwords (Never Regular Password)**
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT
APP_PASSWORD = "abcd efgh ijkl mnop"  # App password

# ‚ùå WRONG - Never use your regular password!
APP_PASSWORD = "myGmailPassword123"
```

**2. Keep Credentials Secret**
```python
# Store in environment variables (production)
import os
EMAIL = os.getenv('GMAIL_ADDRESS')
APP_PASSWORD = os.getenv('GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD')
```

**3. Never Commit Credentials to Git**
```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "config.py" >> .gitignore
echo "*.env" >> .gitignore
```

**4. Test Before Production**
- Test with a secondary Gmail account first
- Review all auto-replies before enabling 24/7
- Monitor the first few hours closely

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "Authentication failed"**
```
‚ùå Failed to connect to IMAP: [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED]
```

**Solutions:**
- Double-check your email and app password
- Make sure you're using an **App Password**, not your regular password
- Verify IMAP is enabled in Gmail settings

---

### **Problem: "No unread emails found"**
```
No unread emails found from 22-Oct-2025 onwards
```

**Solutions:**
- The system only processes **unread** emails
- Try sending a new test email
- Or mark an existing email as unread
- Check if your start date is correct

---

### **Problem: Not receiving replies**

**Solutions:**
- Check your **spam folder**
- Wait for the full check interval (60 seconds)
- Look for error messages in the terminal
- Verify the keyword matching is working

---

### **Problem: "Connection timeout"**

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Gmail servers are accessible
- Try increasing timeout in the code
- Check firewall settings

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. **Start with Whitelist Mode**
Only respond to specific senders:

```python
def process_unread_emails(self):
    # Add this check after getting sender_email
    allowed_senders = ["client@example.com", "boss@company.com"]
    if sender_email not in allowed_senders:
        continue
```

### 2. **Add Time Delays**
Avoid looking too robotic:

```python
import random
time.sleep(random.randint(30, 120))  # Wait 30-120 seconds before replying
```

### 3. **Log Everything**
Track all auto-replies:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='auto_replies.log', level=logging.INFO)
logging.info(f"Replied to {sender_email} at {timestamp}")
```

### 4. **Set Business Hours**
Only send replies during work hours:

```python
from datetime import datetime

current_hour = datetime.now().hour
if 9 <= current_hour <= 17:  # 9 AM to 5 PM
    self.send_reply(...)
```

### 5. **Add Rate Limiting**
Prevent spam:

```python
self.reply_count = {}

def send_reply(self, to_address, ...):
    # Max 3 replies per sender per day
    if self.reply_count.get(to_address, 0) >= 3:
        return False
    
    # Send reply...
    self.reply_count[to_address] = self.reply_count.get(to_address, 0) + 1
```

## üö® Important Notes

### What This Bot Does:
- ‚úÖ Monitors Gmail inbox continuously
- ‚úÖ Sends automatic replies to unread emails
- ‚úÖ Categorizes emails by keywords
- ‚úÖ Marks emails as read after replying
- ‚úÖ Prevents duplicate replies

### What This Bot Doesn't Do:
- ‚ùå Won't reply to emails from yourself
- ‚ùå Won't reply to already-read emails
- ‚ùå Won't reply twice to the same email
- ‚ùå Won't process emails older than start date
- ‚ùå Won't send replies if sending fails

### Safety Checks:
```python
# Self-reply protection
if sender_email == self.email_address:
    continue

# Duplicate prevention
if email_id in self.processed_emails:
    continue

# Error handling
try:
    send_reply(...)
except Exception as e:
    log_error(e)
```
